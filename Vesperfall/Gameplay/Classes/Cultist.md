## Player Character
[[Cult Leader]]

### Key Focuses
1. The player controls the Cult Leader directly, issuing commands and performing rituals to guide followers and influence the battlefield.
2. Follower behavior is central: their actions, assignments, and adherence to tasks determine effectiveness and progression.
3. Followers committing acts tied to the **Seven Deadly Sins** provide special stats and bonuses, enhancing the Cult Leader and the cult’s power.
4. Resource management is critical: nearly every ability, ritual, and summoning depends on careful allocation of resources.
5. Gameplay emphasizes **strategic manipulation**: summoning demons, invoking calamities, or casting curses to disrupt other players and tip the balance in your favor.
6. Units (followers) are the core engine; the Cult Leader amplifies, directs, and exploits their actions rather than engaging directly in combat.
