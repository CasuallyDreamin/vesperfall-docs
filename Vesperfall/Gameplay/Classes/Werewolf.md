### Key Focuses
1. The player can dynamically assign the Alpha role to any of the three werewolves at any point in the game.
2. Alpha selection influences combat bonuses, skill effects, and overall strategy; the choice may change based on stage, enemy type, or environmental conditions.
3. Each werewolf has a distinct stat focus:
   - **Fast**: Very high agility, low strength. Excels at mobility, scouting, and hit-and-run tactics.
   - **Strong**: High strength, low agility. Excels at tanking, melee combat, and absorbing damage.
   - **Adapter**: Low starting stats in all areas; can allocate points to suit different roles as the game progresses.
4. Maintaining balance among the triad is critical: even if one is alpha, the other two contribute to combat and survival; if the Alpha dies, a prepared Elite can take over without catastrophic weakness.
5. Gameplay emphasizes both **individual skill** and **team management**; the player must decide not just who leads, but how to deploy all three effectively.
