## Player Character
[[Hunter Leader]]

### Key Focuses
1. The player controls the Hunter Leader directly, with combat abilities emphasizing precision, mobility, and resourcefulness.
2. Units and tools (temporary companions, traps, or summoned helpers) enhance the Hunter’s effectiveness without replacing the player as the core of gameplay.
3. Gameplay requires **strategic decisions**: which tools or units to deploy, when to engage, and how to balance personal combat with supporting assets.
4. Moderate mechanical demand: less intense than Vampire, but requires situational awareness and planning.
5. Emphasizes **adaptability**: can adjust tactics to map conditions, enemy types, and team cooperation, making the Hunter a jack-of-all-trades in both solo and small-group play.
