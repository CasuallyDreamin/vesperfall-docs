## Player Character
[[Necromancer]]

### Key Focuses
1. The player controls the Necromancer directly, with abilities that manifest through summoned units and magical effects. Examples include skeletal hands, golems, or other constructs that attack or control the battlefield.
2. Units are considered part of the player’s toolkit rather than independent forces; their strength, placement, and timing directly reflect player skill.
3. Uses a unique resource called **Life Essence**, gained through sacrifices of enemies or controlled units, which is spent to raise the dead or power abilities.
4. Gameplay emphasizes **precision, timing, and smart magic usage**; abilities require aiming, prediction, and understanding of battlefield dynamics.
5. Once enough Life Essence is accumulated, the Necromancer can transform into a **Lich**, gaining enhanced magic, combat abilities, and overall battlefield presence.
